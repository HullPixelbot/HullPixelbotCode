Documentation and resources for the HullPixelbot Code robot control langauge

HullPixelbot Code is a simple language that is designed to run in a robot controller. It has been optimised for small size and efficiency and will run well on a basic Arduino device. 

Full details of the language are in the language specification in this documentation. The implementation of the langauge is in the "Robots and Sensors" repository [here](https://github.com/HullPixelbot/RobotSensorsAndMotors).
